## A review on JavaScript.
### Did you know Javascript was first called Mocha, Then LiveScript before the copied the common Java at that Time to get Java Script? Hahaaa

As I kept on dealing with Django and HTML Css, I realized I needed JS as well. So I decided to embark on it and do a review
#### Hope all goes well for it and me

## Thanks
